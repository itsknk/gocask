[phil eaton]("https://eatonphil.com/") told me to read papers and implement them. this was last year. he suggested [delta lake]("https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3411-armbrust.pdf") at the time, so i did it in [python]("https://github.com/itsknk/pydl"). then came the busy, the lazy, the everything. it stopped. march arrived, and the interest returned. a kind reddit user, anonymous and random, suggested bitcask: simpler, good for starting. so i worked for a week. maybe. then again, busy, lazy, everything. it stopped again. now itâ€™s may. here i am, done. so thanks to phil eaton for the idea to read papers, implement them. and thanks to that reddit user, kind and random, dude or dudess? who knows. for the bitcask paper. it was fun, in the end.
